# Description
This repository is a postgres database and shell script application. This repository will load CSV files downloaded from barchart.com. This application requires a certain CSV template, once loaded additional analysis on the data generated from barchart can be used.

Very simple and very useful.

# Changes

### 27th December 2020
1. Created new table called summary, which will hold data including performance strategy, how often data changes, daily or weekly and number of stocks to include.

2. Updated 3mth_ret.sql to include the updated table.

3. Added multiple entries to load script, this now means all the current data is updated, meaning updating spreadsheet becomes much much easier.


## 13th November 2021

When creating the original application, there looks to be a bit of missing structures which is important when I move from one peice of hardware to another. THis change will ensure these are updated correctly and rebuilding becomes easier.
